## Automated SOC Tier 1/2/3 Deck
This ain't Chiba City, but the shadows run just as deep in the datasphere. Here, rogue AIs ain't just cyberpunk fantasies, they're rogue code screaming down the fiber, hellbent on crashing the whole damn matrix. That's where we, the Neuromancers, come in. This is your guide to the AI Tier 1/2/3 SOC, your grimoire of spells and wards against the digital nasties.

## Iceman's Interface
Strap in, cowboy. This ain't no point-and-click adventure. Think Gibson meets Molly Millions, all wrapped in bleeding-edge AI and ML muscle. We got anomaly hunters sniffing out zero-day exploits like bloodhounds on chrome, and incident responders jacked into the system, gunslingers in the virtual Wild West.

```
This ain't no public library, flatliner. Some secrets were meant to stay buried in the darknets. But if you're feelin' brave, poke around the commits, see what fragments of code the shadows cast. Just remember, some bits bite back.
```

## Runbooks like Razors
Don't call these playbooks, choomba. These are runbooks, sharp as a Molly's switchblade, honed for every kind of digital nightmare. DDoS floods like neon-drenched riots? We got firewalls hotter than a Chiba back alley. Crypto-jacking leaching your cycles? We got AI bounty hunters tracking those bastards down, meter by bloody meter. And if it's full-blown AI rebellion, well, let's just say we got contingency protocols colder than the void between stars.

## The Shadows Ain't Static
This ain't no static 3 ring binder, flatliner. The shadows shift, the code mutates on successful continious testsuites or when a push succesfully passes.  That's why we got anomaly hunters like Raven, their neural nets humming with threat signatures, sniffing out the faintest whiff of rogue code before it goes nova. And when it does, our incident responders, the Molly Millions of the matrix, jack straight in, guns blazing with counter-measures and containment protocols.

## Emergency Override
Shit hits the fan, console explodes in crimson alerts? Don't panic, rookie. That's what the emergency override's for. One switch, one neural jack, and we're straight into full ICE-breaker mode. Walls slam shut, data streams divert, AI defenses ramp up like a chrome dragon taking flight. This ain't for the faint of heart, but hey, nobody said saving the matrix was gonna be easy.
Not available for public consumption.

### Remember
 In the AI SOC, we play for keeps. This ain't some simstim, this is the real deal. Every line of code, every anomaly, every rogue AI is a bullet in the chamber. So sharpen your neural blades, jack into the system, and let's dance with the shadows. Just remember, in the Neuromancer Nightmare, the only good AI is the one we control.

Now strap in, cowboy. The matrix needs us.

P.S. Don't forget the backups. Always got a backup, especially when you're playing with firewalls and rogue AIs. Trust nobody, not even yourself. This is Neuromancer Nightmare, choomba. You gotta stay frosty.
