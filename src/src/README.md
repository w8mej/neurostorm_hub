## Overview
A dynamic 3-ring binder offering advanced outcomes for cybersecurity incident management & emergency response; emphasizing innovation and continual improvement.
</br>

These playbooks incorporate the following concepts from operational planning research and day-to-day
experience:

- The planning process and the resulting relationships are just as important as the resulting
artifact(s);

- The books are not scripts to be followed to the letter but are flexible and adaptable to the actual
situation; and

- Effective books convey the goals and objectives of the intended operation and the actions
needed to achieve them.

- Successful operations occur when one knows their roles, understand how they fit into the
plan and can execute the plan.
